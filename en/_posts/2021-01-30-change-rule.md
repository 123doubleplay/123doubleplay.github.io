Baseball has been around [for over 200 years](https://www.papertrell.com/apps/preview/The-Handy-History-Answer-Book/Handy%20Answer%20book/How-old-is-baseball/001137010/content/SC/52cb026d82fad14abfa5c2e0_default.html#:~:text=Baseball%2C%20America's%20pastime%2C%20is%20more,Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum), however, it hasn't always been played by the same rules.

This sport has evolved in such a way that it would seem absurd and irrational to think of playing it as it was played in its origins in some respects.

For example, there was a time when a foul was not considered a [strike under any circumstances](https://sports.stackexchange.com/a/14939). Can you imagine the great advantage for the batter? How long could a turn at bat last? How long could a game last? This reminds me of the previous article, where [we talked about Kairos](https://123doubleplay.com/en/phil/2020/12/30/pandemic-world-series-2020/). We see in modern baseball that, although we continue to live in Kairos, the change in this rule has had, among other consequences, that the duration of a game is much shorter in general.

Do you think most of the sports king's lovers of the time liked the idea of ​​changing that rule? Possibly more than one of them will have said a phrase like: "They just want to ruin this beautiful sport!" or "it has always been played this way and we are good with that." Does it sound familiar to you? Do you think that because something has been done in some way has to continue being done like that?

A similar debate recently arose about the [rule of using a runner in 2nd in extra inings](https://www.mlb.com/news/reasons-new-extra-innings-rule-is-good), this with the intention that the games do not get so long. We can find a variety of arguments for why to do this and why not. Surely all valid, according to a certain point of view.

I also assure you that, both in life and in baseball, the rules of the game are constantly changing.

There is a story that says that on one occasion Einstein was giving an exam to his students. Once he handed out the exam, his assistant asked him: "Professor Einstein, isn't that the same exam that you gave the exact same students last year?" to which he replied "Yes, it is the same." The assistant replied "but Professor Einstein how is it that you have been able to do that?" Einstein calmly said "the answers have changed."

That's right, we live in a world where many questions remain the same, but the answers change. But why do they change? In future posts on this blog we will be analyzing the reason for these changes. Be aware. Be in the game.

For the moment, I leave you with the reflection of this brief analysis on this topic. What has gotten you where you are will not necessarily get you where you want to go, even if you want to stay where you are. That the rules and the answers change, require us to constantly innovate in order to survive or excel. You need evolution, adapt to new changes or be yourself who creates the change.
