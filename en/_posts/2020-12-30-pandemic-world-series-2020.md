In our society, it so usual to live in the time clock, that we don't have the patience for things to happen. Most of the time we live in a hurry. The time clock was called for ancient Greeks, *Chronos*. But also they had a name for the event clock, they called it [*Kairos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos).

One of the aspects that differentiate baseball from the vast majority of other sports, is that the game is developed in *kairos*. The time as we usually think and live in society it doesn't exist in baseball. An inning can take 10 minutes or 30 minutes, doesn't matter, the are 3 outs. A game can last 2 hours or [8 hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_professional_baseball_game#:~:text=The%20Pawtucket%20Red%20Sox%20and,25%20minutes%20of%20playing%20time.), someone has to win, doesn't matter how long it takes.

In baseball, all happen when it has to happen. As a player, you develop a mentality to act at the right moment, not at the right time.

I know that some people can find this aspect of baseball boring. They don't have the patience to stay on the right-field for one hour for the ball to come to you. But the truth is, that although an action doesn't take place, you always need to be mentally active. You have to be in the game!

We always want to adjust our activities by the time clock. The four seasons start at a specific calendar day, like if nature follows that rule.

Even the perception of clock time is sensitive to what happens to you. Have you ever wonder why a day feels that is so long and a year too short?

Who plays and enjoys baseball, for a moment in our chaotic lives, when the umpire call "play ball!", we start living in *kairos*, the perfect time, the time of god.

This 2020 year, the COVID-19 impose some behavior that wasn't usual in our lives. It obligates to live more in *kairos* than *Chronos*. How long I have to be in lockdown? and the experts respond "until the vaccine comes or we know enough about the virus or ...", people don't like this answer, because we want a response that involves time.

Most of the things in life, like in baseball, comes when it has to happen, not before, not after. I believe that if we have clear that, the anxiety and pressure to do things could disappear.

However, not all is black and white. In baseball, we have a season too. In the MLB it takes one year and the team who wins the world series is the king of that year. The losing teams have a moment of sadness for not achieve what they wanted but just after that,e they realize that a new season is yet to come and they have to plan, work and be positive in order to be champion the next year.

2020 comes to the end and although the COVID-19 has won this one, a new year comes, and with that, the hope that human beings will win this time.

That your success in health, wealth, and projects have a good end in this new season that is about to begin.

<br/>
Happy new year!
