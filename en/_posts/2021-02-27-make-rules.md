As we [mentioned before](https://123doubleplay.com/es/phil/2021/01/30/change-rule/), baseball is quite different from its birth. The rule have changed for different reasons. We are used to follow the rules that someone impose on us because that allow use, among other things, be in agreement of what is right and what is wrong without this being subjective. A batter, when putting the ball in play, couldn't run to third base instead of first base, there are rules to follow. Outside of baseball world, there are other rules.

As far as physical security is concerned, in recent years, some rules have been created. For some people are ridiculus, for others a nececisty. For example, now the catcher can not block the home plate in a play without having possession of the ball and the runner can not colide in prupose with the catcher. Prior the implementation of this rule, many catchers had as concuence a short professional live due to injuries caused by collisions. Others catchers can not even continue theirs paths through start theirs careers throgh major leagues due a hard play on home plate. You can whatch in [this video](https://youtu.be/qe3qCWHVh68), some plays before the implementation of this rule. Here it is [an explanation of this rule](https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-institutes-new-rule-on-home-plate-collisions/c-68267610) with more detail. Do you think it will tool a long time to create this rule? Do you think that if you were the running player of the time before the rule, would you go to tackle the catcher in order to score?

The protective equipment that is used by baseball players varies depending on the position being played or the situation. This equipment has evolved gradually since its inception. For example, hitters today are required to use a helmet both hitting and on the bases. However, a long time ago, in the early years of baseball, nobody wear a helmet. Even the pitchers abused the situation and purposely threw to the head with the intention of intimidating the batter. This was not very sporty, but it was allowed. It was not fun for the hitter and even very risky for this individual. The only case of death from a gaming injury recorded in major league baseball, that of [Ray Chapman in 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Chapman), could have been avoided by using an appropiate protection. However, it took 30 years for the rule requiring the player to wear a helmet!

There are a number of possible reasons why, in that period, not enough attempt was made to implement the rule. Being a masculine, men's sport, perhaps the players thought it made them look weak. Or perhaps, it was because the materials at that time were very heavy and not very ergonomic, which bothered them a lot or decreased their visibility. Whatever the reason, it took a long time and in between, few players tried to wear head protection.

In more recent years, with the rule forcing players to wear a helmet, the player [Giancarlo Stanton, was hit in the face by the pitcher](https://youtu.be/W5Bg3oaHI8I). The helmet design was not suitable for this situation. After recovering from the blow and shock, this player now wears a helmet extension that protects the cheek and jaw. From there, many other players began to use helmets of this style. However, the use of a helmet of these characteristics is not mandatory.

Why wouldn't you wear something that can save your life? The easy answer could be, because it is not regulatory. Although there are surely more, I am going to assume that that is the reason. Do you think that Giancarlo goes back to home plate without a helmet with extension? I do not believe so. Although I have not heard him say this explicitly: what he has done is create his own rule.

You might think it's obvious, he already happened to him and that's why he does it. But do you just have to wait for something to happen to you do something about it? Before continuing, I would like to clarify that my intention is not to criticize those who do not use this type of protection, I am taking it as an example of how someone creates their own rules for a simple reason, to protect the most important person, itself.

That's right, you are the most important person to you. I'm not encouraging you to be egocentric, but to a certain extent, everyone makes the best decisions for themselves. For this reason, the rules will not necessarily be oriented to your particular well-being, since whoever creates them, thinks about their own benefit and the about others. This is how our reptilian brain works, our primitive survival instinct.

In this world, on more than one occasion you will find that the rules are delayed to what happens. So, consider creating your own rules.

This not only applies to security issues, it also applies to generating strategies. If you are starting a business, make up your own rules to achieve your goals. If you invest in the stock market, set the rules that you will follow for when to get out with either a profit or a loss. If you play poker, rules for knowing when and how much to raise the stakes. If you are training for a competition in the sport you practice, may be, never go to bed after 10 at night because you have to get up early to start your training the next day. Or as my best friend advises me, the traveler's rule as he named it, if you see something that you like a lot and and have enogh money to buy it, buy it, maybe later you will not find it.

There are many rules in different areas that can be set for your own benefit and protection. Don't wait for others to see for you.

I invite you to play, under your own rules.

If you have a particular rule that you want to share with the world, write it down here, maybe someone else will use it.
