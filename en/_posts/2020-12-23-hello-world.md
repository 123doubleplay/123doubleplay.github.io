In programming, often the first program you create is called ["Hello world"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program). It only has a few lines of code.

In baseball, maybe the closest related thing is the [ceremonial first pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_first_pitch).

So, this is my first “Hello World” post, the ceremonial pitch of this blog.

Play ball!
