When you're inside the batter's box, your concentration and sense of alertness are at peak. A ball traveling 90 mph from the mound to home plate takes about the same time it takes to say "mommy". You have the first half "mo" to decide whether to swing and the second half "mmy" to start swinging and also hit the ball appropriately. Unless scientists saw a human hit a home run, they wouldn't believe this feat was possible. Perhaps for these reasons, hitting has earned a reputation as one of the most difficult procedures to perform among all sports.  

This is what happens inside the batting box, but what happens outside of it? In general, we could say that you have to train hard, eat healthy and sleep well. However, not all of us have the ability to hit a 90-mile fastball after doing everything we are supposed to do.

Who says what are we supposed to do?

It turns out that, both in baseball and in our lives, we live, almost always inside a box.

The boundaries that define this box could be physical, technological, legal, moral, monetary, temporary, among others. This limits us to doing something, yet they still allow us to do many things.

The reality is, that the real box in which we find ourselves is this one:

Most of the time, when a person faces a problem that they cannot solve or a goal that they cannot achieve, they do one of two things: the same, but more insistently or they simply stop trying. One way to open up your outlook and have more options is to think out of the box.

Sometimes you don't need to step outside the box. Just thinking like you are outside the box will allow you to have a totally different vision. 

Although out of the box there will be another box, possibly much larger, that is where the real innovation takes place and allows you to hit your home run.

Enjoy you chances at bat
