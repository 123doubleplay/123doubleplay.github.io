This is a blog where you will find explanations of a variety of concepts using baseball. The concepts range from physics, finance, maths, tech, algorithms, and even philosophy, among others.

In baseball, each position has a number associate with it. For instance, the pitcher is 1, catcher 2 and the 1st base is 3. Among all the double plays possibilities, I consider the 1-2-3 one of the most exciting combinations.<sup>[1](#1)</sup>

On the other hand, in this blog, when you learn something new about baseball and in addition something new about another topic, the call is also:

<center> 1-2-3 Double Play! </center>

From my point of view, an exciting and funny way to teach and learn, and the main reason this blog exists.

Enjoy the content and play ball!
