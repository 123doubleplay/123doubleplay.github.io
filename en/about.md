This is a blog where you will find explanations of a variety of concepts using baseball.

The concepts that you could read in a post range from physics, finance, maths, tech, algorithms and even philosophy, among others.

When you learn something new about baseball and in addition something new about another topic, we call it:

<center> 1-2-3 Double Play! </center>
\\
In baseball, this notation is a way to indicate a double play where the play start with the pitcher (that is the #1), throw it to the catcher (#2), and the catcher throw it to the first base (#3).<sup>[1](#1)</sup> To add more exited to the play, the bases need to be loaded. Watch the Dodgers execute this play in [this video](https://youtu.be/0IIS1bD7DC8).

Among all the double plays possibilities in baseball, I consider it the most exiting combination. The same thing about this blog idea. I hope you too.

Really appreciate your visit. Enjoy the content.
